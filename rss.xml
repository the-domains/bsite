            <title><![CDATA[Experience Rating Analysis - ModMaster | Zywave]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Experience Rating Analysis - ModMaster | Zywave</h1><p>A ModMaster, in my opinion, should be completed every year you receive your workers’ compensation experience mod from the WCRB or NCCI - Immediately.  Wisconsin is actually one of the few states that allows your mod to be refiled in the event you find errors (inaccurate payrolls, class codes, and over-reserved claims).  The ModMaster serves many purposes, but it’s a tool that allows you to catch mistakes if you use it appropriately. If you have not seen or heard of a ModMaster before, please contact tom.boudreau@associatedbrc.com</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/1b704a309ddf454879352c1e8979f6ce/noop.png?input=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.zywave.com%2Fwp-content%2Fthemes%2FZywaveV3%2Fimages%2Fproducts%2Fmm%2FCS3-Slice01.png"></article>]]></description>
