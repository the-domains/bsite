            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Why Slower Drivers Shouldn't Hang Out In the Left Lane</h1><p>The left lane is for passing and slower traffic should keep right.

Manta's Semi-Annual Wellness Index asked small business owners which regulatory rules were the most confusing. OSHA came in a distant fourth: 33% chose tax regulations as the most confusing 21% said the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) 15% chose new U.S.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/334e6f26a27868da2d99258bfceb234c0b2f1842.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Experience Rating Analysis - ModMaster | Zywave</h1><p>A ModMaster, in my opinion, should be completed every year you receive your workers’ compensation experience mod from the WCRB or NCCI - Immediately.  Wisconsin is actually one of the few states that allows your mod to be refiled in the event you find errors (inaccurate payrolls, class codes, and over-reserved claims).  The ModMaster serves many purposes, but it’s a tool that allows you to catch mistakes if you use it appropriately. If you have not seen or heard of a ModMaster before, please contact tom.boudreau@associatedbrc.com</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/1b704a309ddf454879352c1e8979f6ce/noop.png?input=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.zywave.com%2Fwp-content%2Fthemes%2FZywaveV3%2Fimages%2Fproducts%2Fmm%2FCS3-Slice01.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The burden of OSHA (non) compliance just got a lot more costly</h1><p>Basic economics dictate that to change behavior, you must provide strong incentives (or disincentives). For example, look at the demand curve - when something gets more expensive, people buy less of it. So too is the way of compliance - the more costly non-compliance is for an organization, the more likely the organization will engage in compliance.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/1860d2ddc0194fd2e5386393ec584016/noop.png?input=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.associatedfinancialgroup.com%2FPortals%2F0%2FAFGLogo_2x.png"></article>]]></description>
