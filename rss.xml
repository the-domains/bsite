            <title><![CDATA[Experience Rating Analysis - ModMaster | Zywave]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Experience Rating Analysis - ModMaster | Zywave</h1><p>A ModMaster, in my opinion, should be completed every year you receive your workers’ compensation experience mod from the WCRB or NCCI - Immediately.  Wisconsin is actually one of the few states that allows your mod to be refiled in the event you find errors (inaccurate payrolls, class codes, and over-reserved claims).  The ModMaster serves many purposes, but it’s a tool that allows you to catch mistakes if you use it appropriately. If you have not seen or heard of a ModMaster before, please contact tom.boudreau@associatedbrc.com</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/1b704a309ddf454879352c1e8979f6ce/noop.png?input=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.zywave.com%2Fwp-content%2Fthemes%2FZywaveV3%2Fimages%2Fproducts%2Fmm%2FCS3-Slice01.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>10 insurance considerations for emerging businesses</h1><p>Some of the world&rsquo;s greatest corporations were started in the founder&rsquo;s basement or garage. When Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs created Apple, they were not thinking about insurance. They were worried about creating their product, getting it manufactured and getting sales. Everything else was secondary. So how should entrepreneurs approach property/casualty insurance?</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/1860d2ddc0194fd2e5386393ec584016/noop.png?input=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.associatedfinancialgroup.com%2FPortals%2F0%2FAFGLogo_2x.png"></article>]]></description>
