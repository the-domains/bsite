  Young adults with jobs that involve heavy lifting and forceful movements might
  be at higher risk for back pain later in life, a study from Finland suggests.
  "When you're young, you do things your own way, you muscle your way through
  it, but sooner or later, that behavior can cause problems," said Michael
  Timko, a physical therapist and instructor at the University of Pittsburgh who
  was not involved with the study.
