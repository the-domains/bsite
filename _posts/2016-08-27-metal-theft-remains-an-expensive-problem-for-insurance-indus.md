  Metal theft became a growing concern post financial crisis due to rising
  global demand for scrap metal, and although economic conditions have slowed
  demand recently, this expensive crime is still causing headaches for the
  insurance industry. "[Metal theft] is a huge mess that can result in
  considerable claims," said Thomas DeCotis, CEO of DeCotis Insurance Associates
  Inc., a Providence, R.I., based surplus lines wholesaler.
