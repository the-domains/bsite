  Basic economics dictate that to change behavior, you must provide strong
  incentives (or disincentives). For example, look at the demand curve - when
  something gets more expensive, people buy less of it. So too is the way of
  compliance - the more costly non-compliance is for an organization, the more
  likely the organization will engage in compliance.
