  A ModMaster, in my opinion, should be completed every year you receive your
  workers’ compensation experience mod from the WCRB or NCCI - Immediately. 
  Wisconsin is actually one of the few states that allows your mod to be refiled
  in the event you find errors (inaccurate payrolls, class codes, and
  over-reserved claims).  The ModMaster serves many purposes, but it’s a tool
  that allows you to catch mistakes if you use it appropriately. If you have not
  seen or heard of a ModMaster before, please contact
